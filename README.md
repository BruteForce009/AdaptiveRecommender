# Adaptive Recommender
Building a recommendation system that can suggest personalized news articles or blog posts to users based on their reading history and interests. The system should be able to learn and adapt to the user's preferences over time and provide relevant and engaging
content.

Currently works on a basic content based recommendation model. Looking for ways to improve the current model.
